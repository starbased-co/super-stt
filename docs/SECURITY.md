# Super STT Security Model

## Overview

Super STT implements a comprehensive defense-in-depth security model to protect against unauthorized access while maintaining usability. The system uses multiple security layers including Unix domain sockets with group-based access control, process authentication for keyboard access, and input validation throughout.

## Security Architecture Summary

Based on comprehensive security reviews completed in August 2025, Super STT demonstrates **excellent security posture** with:

- ✅ **Process Authentication**: Robust authentication for keyboard injection operations
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Comprehensive framework with DoS protection and attack detection
- ✅ **Memory Safety**: Excellent use of Rust's safety guarantees
- ✅ **Network Security**: Localhost-only UDP binding prevents remote attacks
- ✅ **Resource Management**: Connection limits and rate limiting prevent abuse
- ✅ **Path Security**: Comprehensive validation prevents directory traversal attacks

**Security Assessment**: Production-ready with excellent security controls implemented.

## Socket Permissions

### Production Mode (Default)
- **Permissions**: `0660` (read/write for owner and group)
- **Group**: `stt` 
- **Access**: Only the daemon owner and members of the `stt` group can connect

### Development Mode
- **Permissions**: `0666` (world accessible)
- **Enable**: Automatically enabled in debug builds (`cargo build`)
- **Warning**: Only use for local development, never in production

## Group-Based Access Control

The installation process creates an `stt` system group. Users who need to access the Super STT daemon must be members of this group.

### Setup
```bash
# Automatic during installation
just install-daemon

# Or manual setup
sudo groupadd stt
sudo usermod -a -G stt $USER
# Log out and back in for changes to take effect
```

### Verification
```bash
# Check your groups
groups

# Verify socket permissions
ls -la $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/stt/super-stt.sock
# Should show: srw-rw---- ... user stt ... super-stt.sock
```

## Security Features

### 1. Keyboard Input Protection
- **Process authentication**: Write mode requires verification that the client is the legitimate stt binary
- **Unix socket credentials**: Uses peer credential verification to authenticate processes
- **Debug/release separation**: Authentication automatically disabled in debug builds for development
- **Limited scope**: Only types actual transcription results

### 2. Network Isolation  
- **UDP localhost-only**: Audio streaming bound to `127.0.0.1`
- **No remote access**: Network connections impossible
- **Read-only broadcast**: Only sends visualization data

### 3. Process Authentication
- **Unix peer credentials**: Verifies connecting process PID, UID, and executable path
- **Binary verification**: Ensures only the legitimate stt binary can trigger write mode
- **Compile-time security**: Uses `cfg!(debug_assertions)` to automatically disable in debug builds
- **Fallback checks**: Validates process name if path verification fails

### 4. Input Validation and DoS Protection
- **Comprehensive validation**: All external inputs validated with strict limits
- **Audio data protection**: Maximum 30 minutes of audio at 16kHz to prevent memory exhaustion
- **Sample rate validation**: Must be between 8kHz and 96kHz
- **JSON protection**: Size (1MB) and nesting depth (10 levels) limits prevent JSON bomb attacks
- **Suspicious pattern detection**: Detects potential padding attacks in audio data
- **Control character filtering**: Prevents injection of dangerous characters

### 5. Resource Management and Rate Limiting
- **Connection limits**: Maximum concurrent connections enforced (20 in production, 50 in development)
- **Rate limiting**: Per-client request limits with sliding window tracking
  - Production: 60 requests/minute, 1800 requests/hour
  - Development: 300 requests/minute, 7200 requests/hour
- **Connection timeouts**: Automatic cleanup of inactive connections (3 minutes production, 10 minutes development)
- **Memory protection**: Resource limits prevent memory exhaustion attacks

### 6. Process Isolation
- **User service**: Runs under user account, not root
- **Group separation**: Multi-user systems can control access via group membership
- **Socket permissions**: Enforced at filesystem level
- **Process authentication**: SO_PEERCRED verification for privileged operations

## Best Practices

### For Single-User Systems
The default configuration is secure for personal desktop use:
```bash
just install-daemon
```

### For Multi-User Systems
1. Ensure only trusted users are in the `stt` group
2. Consider using separate user accounts for the daemon
3. Monitor group membership: `getent group stt`

### For Development
Debug builds automatically use relaxed security for development convenience:
```bash
# Debug build - automatically skips process authentication
cargo run --bin super-stt

# Release build - enforces full security model
cargo run --release --bin super-stt
```

## Threat Model

### Protected Against
- ✅ Unauthorized local users accessing the daemon
- ✅ Remote network attacks (localhost-only UDP binding)
- ✅ Unauthorized keyboard injection (process authentication with SO_PEERCRED)
- ✅ Arbitrary command injection via keyboard
- ✅ Privilege escalation (runs as user service with group controls)
- ✅ Memory exhaustion attacks (comprehensive input validation)
- ✅ Connection flooding attacks (rate limiting and connection limits)
- ✅ JSON bomb attacks (size and depth validation)
- ✅ Directory traversal attacks (path validation)
- ✅ Audio data injection attacks (sample validation and pattern detection)
- ✅ Process impersonation (binary path and name verification)

### Assumptions
- Physical access to the machine is trusted
- Users in the `stt` group are trusted
- System has standard Unix permission enforcement
- Development builds are only used in secure development environments

## Incident Response

### Suspicious Activity
Check daemon logs for unauthorized access attempts:
```bash
journalctl --user -u super-stt -f
```

### Revoke Access
Remove a user from the stt group:
```bash
sudo gpasswd -d username stt
```

### Emergency Shutdown
```bash
systemctl --user stop super-stt
systemctl --user disable super-stt
```

## Security Testing and Verification

### Security Reviews Completed
- **August 2025**: Comprehensive security review of all components
- **Verification**: All critical findings verified and addressed
- **Assessment**: Production-ready security posture confirmed

### Security Testing Coverage
- ✅ Input validation boundary testing
- ✅ Authentication bypass attempt testing
- ✅ Resource exhaustion protection testing
- ✅ Path traversal attack testing
- ✅ Memory safety analysis
- ✅ Process authentication verification

### Continuous Security
- Regular dependency security audits via `cargo audit`
- Comprehensive test coverage for security-critical functions
- Static analysis with Rust's built-in safety guarantees
- Input fuzzing for protocol handlers

### Running Security Audits
Check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies:
```bash
# Install cargo-audit (one-time setup)
cargo install cargo-audit

# Run security audit
cargo audit

# Update dependencies and re-audit
cargo update
cargo audit
```

## Deployment Security Checklist

- [ ] Use release builds (`cargo build --release`)
- [ ] Configure `stt` group membership properly
- [ ] Verify socket permissions are 0660
